# JavaScript
## Breif Summary

So far we've learned that HTML is the bones and CSS is the skin and today we learned about the brains AKA **JacaScript**,

1. Javascript makes our website functional and not dull and dumb.
2. You can make your website dynamic and compatable with different platforms.
3. Never write your javascript at the beggining of the HTML as it may cause malfunctions.
4. We can use the javascript to control our HTML and CSS when different events occur.
5. Java script is linked to the HTML using the tag `<script src= "path"></script>`.
6. We also learned how to copy the content of one repo to another using the `code cp -r source distination`.
