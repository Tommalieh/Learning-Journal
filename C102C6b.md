# How Computers Work


* Computers were invented to **carry** and **manipulate** information such as how mechanical machines were designed to manipulate physical stuff
And it was designed to do 4 things:

1. **Take an input**
2. **Store it**
3. **Process it**
4. **Give an output**

* Though we came so far in computer technology it still holds the same basic fucntionality of the previous 4 points.

* The **input** is what the user orders the computer to do wether it is a *voice input* or *a click* or *visual input* ...etc

* The computer then **stores** this **input** as an **information** inside it's **memory**

* The computer's **processor** takes this **information** and **manipulates** it using it **algorithms** _(which is a series of commands)_

* The computer **restores** the processed information in the **memory** and the last 2 steps are repeated till all information is ready to be delivered as an **output**

* An output varies depending on the type of the computer, it could be **visual**, **audio**, **text**, **AR**, **vr** ...etc

* This **output** could be used as an **input** to another computer for another process

* All computers use the **binary system** to **represent** all types of contents such as **text images**, **sounds** and **videos** by **converting** these content into **numbers** and then those numbers are **represented** in the **binary system** which later on is represented by the computer

* The binary system is a way to **carry electrical signals as information** through wires where each wire **represents a 0 or a 1**, a true or false

* Circuts are the components that are responsible for processing those information

* Each circut is a **logical process of 0s and 1s**, and by combining multiple tiny circuts togother we can process all types of information

* The more complicated the information gets the more powerful computer is needed to be able to store and process such information

* Even the advanced coding languages we use today get converted into 0s and 1s, a simple tag element consists of hunderds and thousands of 0s and 1s

* The **CPU** is the component that is responsible of doing all these processes

* The **OS** such as **Windows** is the master program that decide what other smaller programs can access of the input and output components on the computer

_**In the end the only thing that makes computers smarter each day is **US!!****_
