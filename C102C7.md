# JavaScript
### A Summary



## Introduction


JavaScript can be used to select any **element**, **attribute**, text from an HTML page. To **_add_ elements**, **attributes**, and **text** to the page, or **remove them**.


Also it could be used to **specify a set of steps for the browser to follow** *(like a recipe)*, which **allows it to access or change the content of a page**.

* Browser compatibility is very important for the code to work so make sure to use a modern browser like Chrome or FireFox

JavaScript is a programming langauge using **"Script"** as it's core principle, A script is a *series of instructions* that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. To **write** a script, you need to first **state** your **goal** and then **list** the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

Start with the **big picture** of what you want to achieve, and **break** that down into **smaller steps**. Once you know the goal of your script, you can work out the individual tasks needed to be acheived. This can be **represented** using a **flowchart**, and translate these steps into code.

* Always think like you were the computer and it will be easier to find the right approch to write the code.

An expression **evaluates** into *(results in)* a single value, Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions:

1. **EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE** 
2. **EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE**


## Operators 

Expressions rely on things called **operators**, they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values, there are many types of operators and each operator does a certain job, some of these operators are the following:

1. **ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS**: Assign a value to a variable  `color = 'beige';`
2. **COMPARISON OPERATORS**: Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se  `buy = 3 > 5;`
3. **ARITHMETIC OPERATORS**: Perform basic math `area = 3 * 2;`
4. **LOGICAL OPERATORS**: Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se `buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);` 
5. **STRING OPERATORS**: Combine two strings `greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Molly';`


## Functions

* **Functions** let you **group** a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function *(rather than repeating the same set of statements)*. 

* To **create** a function, give it a name and write the code needed to be executed inside the curly brackets, it should look like something like that `function sayHello(){document.write('Hello!')};`

* To execute *(call)* a function you write the function name followed by peranthasis, it should look like `sayHello();`

* Some functions need some information *(parameters)* to preform it's task, in such cases we put this information inside the **paranthesis**, and it should look like `function getArea(width, height){return width * height;}` were *(width and height)* are the parameters.

* To **call** a function that requires parameters, we replace the parameters with there **values** to be put in the function, it should look like `getArea(3,5)` where *(width= 3, and height= 5)*

* Some functions return an **output** when we call them, for example a **summation function** returns the result of adding naumbers.
