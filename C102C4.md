# HTML & CSS
## A Quick Summary

### HTML

*It stands for _HyperText Markup Language_ and it represents and forms the content (_Structure_) of the website with no styling yet.

*We can write in HTML using any text editor but it will only be executed as an HTML page only if our file has _.html_ as the extension.

*The HTML syntax mainly cosist of _tags and attributes_.

*When we are creating a website we should keep in mind who's going to be vising the site and what type of demographic they are.

*It's always helpful to create a fake audience to test your approach on them before hand.

*Always try to create a wireframe of the website before you start coding as it helps stay focused on what to do and in order.

*Always be creative and try things you didn't try before.
