# Class 3
## Git & GitHub

So for todays class about **Git** and **GitHub** we've learned how to use the **terminal** to make changes and **push** them to the **cloud** and this could be done by following the steps below:

1. *Cloning your repo* 
**You do this step in order to get your repo from your cloud into your machine**
   * Firstly you get the the link to your repo from the dropdown button saying "Clone or Download" 
   * using the code >git clone 'The link to your repo between the qoutations'
2. *Change your location to where your clone is* 
3. *Now you can use the codes git add, git push and git commit to commit and push your changes.*

_**And always remember to add commit and push befor you leave ;)**_
