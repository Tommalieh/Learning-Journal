# CSS
## A brief summary

So aftr learning how to build the structure of the website using HTML now we will learn about presenting what we built in an attractive and stylized way using CSS.

* CSS is considered the skin that covers the structure of our bodies it's how we are presented to other people.
* CSS can is written using a syntax of selectors, these selectors do what it's name says; they select and element and then we assign a property such as color, size and width to that element.
* There are many types of selectors such as tag selectors, class selectors and id selectors each is different in syntax and priority.
* CSS is linked to HTML in 3 different ways but we will only be using the external method which is done by writing our CSS in a new file and linking it using the link tag `<style rel= "stylesheet" src= "path"></style>`
